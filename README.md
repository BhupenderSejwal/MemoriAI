🧠 MemoriAI – AI-Powered Cognitive Assistant for Alzheimer’s Care
📘 Overview

MemoriAI is an AI-powered digital companion designed to support individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.
It provides cognitive recall assistance, adaptive reminders, and a caregiver dashboard — helping patients maintain independence and enabling caregivers to monitor well-being.

The system integrates FastAPI microservices, LangChain-based AI inference, SQLite + VectorDB storage, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines deployed in Azure.

🧩 Key Features

🧠 Cognitive & Identity Assist – Personalized memory recall and word-aid service

⏰ Daily Reminders & Safety Alerts – Smart reminders with adherence tracking

📊 Caregiver Dashboard – Summaries, visual insights, and adherence metrics

🔒 Security by Design – OAuth2 + JWT, RBAC, PHIPA/HIPAA compliance

⚙️ Scalable Microservices – FastAPI, Docker, and Azure App Service deployment

🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a Service-Oriented Microservice Architecture with clear separation of concerns:

Layer	Description
Frontend	Streamlit-based caregiver dashboard (web/mobile)
Backend	FastAPI-based Cognitive, Reminder, and Dashboard microservices
Storage	SQLite (structured) + VectorDB (semantic memory)
AI Engine	LangChain + Guardrailed LLM for safe phrasing (no medical advice)
MLOps/DevOps	GitHub Actions → Docker → Azure Deployment → Monitoring (Grafana/Prometheus)

📄 See /docs/MemoriAI_Architecture_Overview_v3.docx for diagrams and design details.

🧠 Core Microservices
Service	Purpose	Key Endpoint	Auth	Latency (p95)
Cognitive Service	Memory recall, word-aid, identity questions	/api/v1/cognitive/ask	JWT	< 800 ms
Reminder Service	Scheduling and reminders	/api/v1/reminder/create	JWT	< 500 ms
Dashboard Service	Caregiver insights & summaries	/api/v1/dashboard/summary	JWT	< 600 ms
